# FAQ

## Is this a new blockchain?
No, this is a distributed application built on top of an existing
blockchain.

## What blockchain are you built on?
We are building our smart-contracts on top of Solana, but we are minting
out tokens on Ethereum, and we bridge the two worlds using Wormhole.

## Why did you choose Solana/Ethereum?
The Solana platform has addressed many of the outstanding problems found
in similar popular blockchains like Ethereum (i.e. transaction-speed
energy-efficiency infinite-smart-contract-loops etc). While our idea is
&mdash; in principle &mdash; possible to implement on most blockchains,
doing on Solana would help us scale more easily and also more cheaply.
Additionally we think that the Solana development-stack is
well-documented and robust enough to act as a solid foundation for the
interlock network. And lastly, Solana's growing popularity will help us
attract new contributors to the project. We chose to mint out tokens on
Ethereum because that chain has a large user-base and ecosystem and we
would like to be compatible with it. To that end we use Wormhole to
allow people to transfer their INTER tokens between chains.

## What problem are you trying to solve?
We are trying to democratize and decentralize *trust* on the internet.

We believe that the new paradigm for the internet/web is
hyper-decentralization. The web is decentralizing the media and the news
and the publishing industry. The web is decentralizing geography &mdash;
two people a million miles away can interact with each other over
video-chat or VR. The web is decentralizing finance &mdash; even stuffy
old banks want to get in on the DeFi bandwagon. The web is
decentralizing the nation-state &mdash; people often times have more in
common with globally dispersed like-minded individuals than their fellow
neighbors and citizens. The web is decentralizing employment &mdash; the
number of people working in the gig-economy and the creator-economy is
increasing.

We believe that this accelerating trend of hyper-decentralization will
also decentralize the parts of the web that have to do with *trust*.
Right now, the intermediary institutions (i.e. Facebook, Twitter,
Reddit, HN, and so on) that ascribe credibility and trustworthiness do
so in ways that are *opaque*. We do not know *why* certain content
appears in our feeds and other content does not &mdash; and even if we
did, there is nothing we can do to fine-grained-ly *customize* our feed
(aside from following/unfollowing various accounts). The near-total
centralization of trust and identity does have some security benefits
(i.e. it may be safer to trust the content in your feed than the content
outside the walled garden), but it comes at the cost of users
outsourcing a growing share of their online decision-making to
product-managers and growth-hackers.

Decentralization occurs when a previously trusted, large, central
institution **betrays** the trust of its users, customers, and
constituents &mdash; as in 2008 when the banks and related financial
companies caused the financial-crisis and the subsequence sovereign
debt-crisis. Arguably the same has happened between 2015 and 2021,
except this time the Big Tech companies are playing the role of the
banks &mdash; and right now Apple, Google, and Facebook are being
dragged through the court-systems of every major jurisdiciton on earth.
This is the beginning of a long decline for the most influential and
widely used internet-companies, which means that the next decade is
going to be one of, decreasing online-safety, increasing
online-decentralization, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash;
**increasing online-opportunity**, on the internet.

We want **to create a decentralized and easy-to-use network** that will
**actively protect** you from existing and emerging new threats, while
also creating **concrete incentives and disincentives** for
participating and enriching the network.

## Why should I care about the problem you are trying to solve?
If you care about effective and non-intrusive security for yourself and
your friends and colleagues, that carries the possibility of reward,
then you also care about the problem we are trying to solve.

## What is the difference between you and MSFT ION?
Microsoft'S ION project is a decentralized P2P identity network &mdash;
it does not yet have features pertaining to *trust* and *security*. Same
goes for any other identity network, like fractal, cheqd, and soverin.

## Where does this solution fit in the big picture.
Very simply, you install our extension, and it will detect fraudulent
websites as you browse in real time, while preventing you from divulging
any sensitive information to said website. The extension also allows you
to flag harmful websites that we miss, or unflag nonharmful websites.
You can also choose to share some/all/none (the default is none) of your
browsing data with us, so that we can enrich our threat-intelligence
dataset. For doing these things you can receive INTER tokens, which you
can exchange for other currencies at an exchange, or use them with our
other products. You can also use these tokens to *stake* any
grey-area-entities that we have accumulated (i.e. entities that our
heuristics have not been able to categorize as a high-probability threat
or non-threat) &mdash; we are letting software to do what it excels at
(i.e. approximate categorization at scale), and letting people do things
they are good at (i.e. precise and nuanced disambiguation) via
crowdsourcing.

## What parts of your stack are open-source?
Obviously the underlying blockchains &mdash; solana and ethereum &mdash;
are both open-source. Also, all of our smart-contracts are open-source
&mdash; because that is just how blockchain works. Our uBlock-based
browser-extension is also open source. The backend parts of our stack
(i.e. the data-processing pipeline and our database) are closed source
&mdash; as are our web-frontends (i.e. the dashboard for stakers). We
*may* open-source the backend components, once they become more mature,
or if the community expresses interest in it.

## How did you implement this trust-network?
Please see our technical-whitepaper and Github for implementation
details.

## Are you a security company?
Interlock is not a security company &mdash; we are a web3 company
founded by people that have years of experience in the security-space.
You could think of us as a *next generation* security company, or a
security company for the web3 era.

## What kind of anonymity do you offer?
The interlock network is built around anonymouse accounts &mdash; we
never require you to identify yourself with a phone number or an email
address. You can have as many accounts as you want, and if **you** want
to link any of those accounts to your real-world identity, that is up to
you.

## What interfaces do you offer for accessing the network?
We try to make the network as accessible as possible. Initially we plan
to offer a Web Interface and a Browser Extension. These two interfaces
are not interchangeable and serve different purposes.

## How does the Interlock Extension differ from the Interlock Web Interface?
The web-interface lets you access and query the data collected from the
interlock network &mdash; it is basically a web interface to a
data-base. The interlock-extension actively protects you from phishing
attacks and block advertisements &mdash; you can also use it to interact
with the interlock-network.

## How do people earn money on your network?
People earn money either by using our extension passively, optionally
and anonymously sharing a subset of their browsing data, or by actively
flagging and staking grey-area-entities.

## This sounds cool and I would like to be involved &mdash; are you accepting any kind of investment?
We plan on pursuing a variety of fund-raising strategies. For starters
we plan on doing a DAICO.

## This sounds cool and I would like to be involved &mdash; are you accepting any kind of coding contributions?
We are fully open source and will happily accept coding contributions.
We are considering financing bug-bounty programs using our Inter Token.

## This sounds cool and I would like to be involved &mdash; are you accepting any kind of writing contributions?
We would appreciate any kind of documentation or evangelism in the form
of writing. We would happily compensate you using the Inter Token.

## This sounds cool and I would like to be involved &mdash; is there a place where I can ask questions and particpate in discussions?
We have a discord channel, a twitter, and a github. We may add more
venues for discussions in the future.

## Is this project open source?
Yes, this project is open source.

## Does this project have a specific governance model?
Regarding technical contribution we will follow an RFD/RFC model where
project design documents are proposed and discussed on various community
channels (i.e. github, discord, and others). If the project and
community get large enough we will likely adopt a governance model akin
to Rust's. We diverge from the traditional RFC process in that we (a)
adopt proposals by voting via smart-contract and (b) developers can show
their support and affinity for each-other and their ideas by using the
upvote/downvote mechanism that is already in place. We do not require
separate personal and developer accounts, but we also do not require the
same account. Keeping with the theme of privacy and anonymity a
developer can have as many accounts as they want and the
project/community would have no way of knowing &mdash; which is
*already* the situation in the real world (i.e. one can make as many
github accounts as they want). Voting is consensus-driven &mdash;
proposals require unanimous approval. Unanimous consensus is meant to
eliminate the competitive nature of voting &mdash; all disagreements
should be resolved at the *discussion* phase before a proposal comes to
a vote. We believe that there are very few *true* and *unresolvable*
contradictions in engineering. Proposals can be resubmitted for voting.
