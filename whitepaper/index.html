<p>The web requires <em>trust</em> between participants to reach its fullest<br />
potential. However, we have centralized the trust-rating function to a<br />
handful of gatekeepers, who themselves have questionable credibility and<br />
competence. We propose a solution that uses blockchain and other<br />
technologies to increase security, privacy, and trust and bypasses those<br />
gatekeepers.</p>

<p>The thing about these kinds of papers —  whitepapers —  is<br />
that they are supposed to be confident, authoritative, and seductive.<br />
Why, we hear you ask? Because stringing together words that create an<br />
impression of authoritative and seductive confidence is what often<br />
convinces people buy whatever it is you are selling. Everybody wants to<br />
invest in the impossible-to-miss certain-to-win solution to some problem<br />
that the market has. We have gone through a lot of whitepapers written<br />
with the confidence and certainty of a devout missionary seeking<br />
converts and, of course, donors. We are not going to do that to you.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, we <em>are</em> trying to <em>convince</em> you of the merits of our<br />
vision and idea —  we just have no interest in <em>hypnotizing</em> you<br />
into agreeing with us. If you believe that the Web is not living up to<br />
its founding promises —  and you want to change this —  then<br />
please read on.</p>

<p>The writers of this paper, dear reader, are old enough to remember the<br />
following: napster, gnutella, bit-torrent, Usenet, slashdot, RSS Feeds,<br />
Tor, Google before it became evil, and Open Source before it became<br />
cool.  We remember an internet where nobody knew that you were a dog<br />
— and, more importantly, nobody cared. We remember when being<br />
social on the internet meant that you had a blog, read(and shared files<br />
on) USENET, and participated in Slashdot discussions and flame-wars as<br />
an &#x27;Anonymous Coward&#x27;. We remeber that being informed meant that you<br />
used Google Reader —  RIP —  to read RSS feeds which were<br />
absolutely everywhere. And if you <em>really</em> wanted to stick it to The<br />
Man, you installed Linux on your second-hand beige-box and Firefox on<br />
your folks&#x27; Windows computer —  we still have vivid memories and<br />
strong feelings about MSFT, and quite a bit of residual PTSD and mental<br />
scar-tissue. But, somewhere along the way, the internet took a turn. Now<br />
people use Facebook instead of USENET, Twitter instead of RSS, and<br />
Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify instead of BitTorrent. Also USENET,<br />
Slashdot, and friends are all ghost-towns —  while their nearest<br />
equivalents have been overrun by trolls, cat-pictures, memes,<br />
advertisers, and cybercriminals. Oh, and Microsoft is an increasingly<br />
popular and increasingly open-source company — which is as<br />
inconceivable as Ghengis Khan becoming an exemplary Red Cross volunteer.</p>
<p>Clearly, there has been a pendulum swing from a decentralized and<br />
democratic internet to one that is significantly more centralized and<br />
autocratic. A significant driver of this centralization has been the<br />
insight that the majority of people are busy enough that they will give<br />
up control for convenience —  especially if that convenience has a<br />
price-tag approaching <em>zero</em>. With the increase in convenience, things<br />
like web-pages and blogs could be created by people who did not know how<br />
to program or administer computers. And even if you did have this<br />
skill-set, chances are you would apply it to a <em>virtual</em> computer in the<br />
<em>cloud</em> rather than a physical one in your closet. This centralization<br />
of computing was not sinister or evil —  far from it —  but<br />
it was, rather paradoxically, a leap towards making the web accessible<br />
and useful to more people than ever before. In other words,<br />
centralization <em>did</em> democratize <em>participation</em> in the web, but it came<br />
at the expense of freedom, control, and privacy. The web that you see<br />
today, is the web that Google wants you to see when you use their<br />
search, that Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram want you to see when you<br />
scroll through &#x27;your&#x27; feed. And what they want you to see, is whatever<br />
will make you re-share the content or click on an advertisement. You<br />
are, in effect, plugged into The Matrix —  the entire cyberpunk<br />
oevre is not merely dystopic fiction, it is part prophesy and part<br />
warning.</p>
<p>Maybe you are thinking, that does not sound so bad —  maybe we<br />
<em>have</em> to sacrifice freedom, control, and privacy to democratize<br />
participation in the web. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe that is <em>exactly</em> what<br />
the feudal Serfs were thinking while they were working the fields of<br />
their lords —  maybe we have to sacrifice control over our bodies,<br />
our labor, and the (literal) fruits of that labor to democratize<br />
participation in agriculture. After all, what is the alternative?<br />
Starvation?</p>
<p>We sympathize, dear reader. We sympathize with you, because it is a<br />
perfectly reasonable question to ask. Yes, being excluded and isolated<br />
from the means of production of our era, is infinitely worse than having<br />
our every action tracked, classified, and monetized. But unlike the<br />
quarries, mines, farms, plantations, factories, and refineries of<br />
previous eras —  which all required capital to establish and<br />
maintain and upgrade —  the means of production of <em>our</em> era is,<br />
well, <strong>us</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you post on reddit? <em>You</em> are creating the value, <em>they</em> are<br />
capturing it. Do you make videos for YouTube? <em>You</em> are creating the<br />
value, <em>they</em> are capturing it. Do you create content for OnlyFans?<br />
<em>You</em> are creating the value, <em>they</em> are capturing it.</p>
<p><em>They</em> conceive of a world where they data-mine —  yes, the<br />
exploitative nature of their business models is even reflected in their<br />
<em>jargon</em> —  everything we do, turn that data into money, and <em>we</em><br />
get(basically imaginary) shares, retweets, mentions, likes,<br />
so-called-friends, and so-called-followers. They have even removed<br />
negative actions such as dislikes for fear that it will drive users<br />
—  another revealing bit jargon —  away. Their mission is to<br />
keep us happy and cheerful while we(happily and cheerfully) make them<br />
money. You know who also does this? Farmers. What does that make <em>us</em>?<br />
Livestock. Are you tired of being milked yet?</p>

<p>The previous section was a little bleak — we will give you that. But<br />
— as you can probably surmise from this section&#x27;s title — this paper<br />
is going to get bleaker before it gets brighter.</p>
<p>If the end of the previous section has you feeling like you have been<br />
conned, like you are —  sooner or later —  the eventual<br />
victim of an unsustainable and tenuous pyramid scheme, well, that was<br />
our intent. To be clear, we are not trying to scare you with ghost<br />
stories.  We <em>wish</em> these were just ghost stories —  the<br />
exaggerations of a handful of nerds, hackers, and cypherpunks trying to<br />
shock you into listening. But the pyramid is built on a shaky foundation<br />
and the dangers are real.</p>
<p>How could it get worse? Well, in addition to being exploited, and<br />
metaphorically robbed, by the feudal lords of the internet, you are also<br />
being exploited, and <em>literally</em> robbed, by the scammers and criminals<br />
that have a growing presence on the internet. We have a multitude of<br />
delightful statistics that back up this claim. The areas of cybercrime,<br />
fraud, and identity-theft are so ripe and pregnant with opportunities<br />
that even nation-states are eager to get in on it —  and they are<br />
not even trying to conceal their involvment. Yes, they give <em>zero</em><br />
fucks, because they are confident that the majority of the populace is<br />
too distracted and too impoverished to actually —  in the words of<br />
Morpheus —  <em>wake up</em>.</p>
<p>The obvious question is, why are there so many scammers and<br />
cybercriminals. What is there to steal? Is it worth the risk? What are<br />
the risks? Well, the modern cybercriminal is not like a bank-robber or<br />
hostage-taker. The bank-robber or hostage-taker uses coercion and<br />
intimidation to steal money. The modern cybercriminal is more like the<br />
mythical japanese creature <em>noppera-bo</em>. This creature is a faceless<br />
ghost that steals the faces of humans. Cybercrime is about stealing<br />
people&#x27;s faces and using them as masks —  it is about <em>deception</em><br />
more than it is about coercion or violence. The faces in this metaphor<br />
are usually authentication-credentials that may lead the criminal to<br />
their ultimate goal, currency, crypto or otherwise.</p>
<p>And that is just the most obvious form of theft —  material theft.<br />
Once business and politics and religion enter the equation, lines and<br />
categories start to get blurry very fast. For example, can <em>truth</em> be<br />
stolen? If so, does that make a flat-earther a criminal? What about the<br />
corporate marketing department that uses flawed benchmarking<br />
methodologies to convince you that their product is superior to the<br />
competition? What about alternative or traditional medicine books? What<br />
about the <em>hundreds</em> of pseudo-historical, pseudo-scientific, and<br />
pseudo-sociological narratives that are weaved every election cycle to<br />
convince people that their neighbors and fellow citizens are the cause<br />
of their anguish —  rather than the massive institutions,<br />
corporations, and beaurocracies that have every incentive to profit from<br />
and perpetrate anguish and tragedy across continents and across<br />
generations(you do not have to look further than McDonalds and<br />
Phillip-Morris)?</p>
<p>The point is, the truth is very important, but it can be hard to pin<br />
down. Very few things can be considered absolute truths. The web —<br />
under its current commercialized and oligarchic stewardship —<br />
perpetuates, exacerbates, and profits from, vanity, greed, delusion,<br />
ignorance, envy, hatred, and outrage. Instead, it should give users the<br />
tools to better understand themselves, human nature, and our<br />
connectedness to all things —  an ancient idea that is in fact<br />
more relevant to the modern world than it ever was to the ancient world.</p>
<p>Criminals and tech corporations both see the internet-user as something<br />
to be exploited. The fromer seeks to attack and corrupt the state of<br />
your bank account, while the latter seeks to attack and corrupt your<br />
state of mind. You will find it easy, even effortless, to be angry with<br />
the former, but you may find it difficult to be angry with the latter<br />
— you cannot be angry with the tobacco company for selling you<br />
exactly what you asked for.</p>

<p>Before 1971, if you held a dollar in your hand and examined what was<br />
written on it, you would see &#x27;Exchangeable for Gold&#x27;. After 1971, it<br />
would only say &#x27;In God We Trust&#x27;. We used to believe in the dollar<br />
because we used to believe in gold —  now we believe in the dollar<br />
because we believe in the dollar. This is what some historians would<br />
call a revolution, others would call it a <em>paradigm shift</em>. Paradigm<br />
shifts, and for that matter paradigms themselves, are —  and<br />
please do not mistake this for belittlement, quite the opposite in fact<br />
— entirely <em>imaginary</em>. You cannot measure or touch a paradigm. A<br />
paradigm does not emit heat or have mass. Yet paradigms have been the<br />
organizing principle of society since humanity learned how to speak and<br />
write things down. A paradigm is a shared hallucination.</p>
<p>Every paradigm contains the seeds of its own destruction. The bible was<br />
the first book that was mass-printed —  shortly after that the<br />
catholic church lost half of its believers to the various protestant<br />
denominations. The feudal and heriditary paradigms of Europe were eroded<br />
and overthrown by the steady growth of capitalism. The industrial<br />
capitalist paradigm had, after the Great Depression, given birth to both<br />
fascism and communism. And the surviving contenders of the Second World<br />
War, created the Cold War (i.e. bipolar) paradigm. This paradigm<br />
collapsed into one of globalisation and informationalism. New gods for<br />
old.</p>
<p>Trust, just like a paradigm, is powered by <em>belief</em>. You cross the<br />
street with minimal anxiety because you trust the drivers to be sober<br />
enough to obey the traffic laws(also a good example of a paradigm). You<br />
use the same two passwords on every site because you trust that the<br />
programmers that made the site have a minimal level of technical<br />
competence and a minimal regard for your security and privacy. Some<br />
Runescape-playing twelve-year-old kid drops all their hard-earned loot<br />
in front of another player and presses <code v-pre>Alt-F4</code> because that other<br />
player told them it was a glitch that would duplicate all of the items<br />
in their inventory — that kid <em>trusted</em> someone who was<br />
<em>untrustworthy</em>, and learned a <em>painful</em> but <em>important</em> lesson about<br />
<em>trust</em>. The internet is basically like that Runescape example. The<br />
entire system depends on trust to get anything done, but there are too<br />
many people and you cannot trust them blindly. What to do? Well, we did<br />
what we have always done, we created institutions (i.e. social networks<br />
and banks) and placed our <em>trust</em> and our <em>faith</em> in <em>them</em>. It sounds<br />
perfectly reasonable, no? Sure. But such institutions are powered by<br />
people, and the people —  just like criminals and liars —<br />
have to respond to market-pressures. We used to <em>trust</em> our<br />
credit-rating-agencies to tell us which financial entities were<br />
<em>creditworthy</em> —  and then we had an economic <em>meltdown</em> in 2008<br />
that destroyed the <em>trustworthiness</em> of those institutions themselves.<br />
Centralizing trust in a handful of institutions will work in a pinch but<br />
it could eventually, and without warning, fail —  every paradigm<br />
contains the seeds of its own destruction.</p>

<p>The internet, and especially the Web, are either the result or cause<br />
—  hard to tell really —  of a paradigm shift. The mass<br />
on-lining of humanity has shifted the power (i.e. the value or economic<br />
surplus) from the previous power-holders (i.e. the mass media, the<br />
industry, the publishers, etc). Think about it, more people watched the<br />
Fortnite tournament than actual sporting events. In fact, viewership of<br />
the <em>Olympics</em> has started declining towards the end of the last decade<br />
—  after a half century of <em>growing</em> viewership. Book stores are<br />
no longer mainstream, and the internet&#x27;s pre-eminent book store has<br />
evolved into a titanic giant that sells <em>everything</em> and delivers it to<br />
your residence within 2 days —  and they also collect rents for<br />
roughly <em>one third</em> of all computation and storage that is provisioned<br />
on a Cloud. A ride-sharing company has displaced local taxi-cab<br />
companies <em>in the entire world</em> —  not merely in a city or a state<br />
or a nation.  Video rental stores probably do not exist, but the<br />
internet&#x27;s pre-eminent video rental store has emerged as a formidable<br />
cultural force spending tens of billions of dollars per year producing<br />
original and highly regarded, or at least highly viewed, films and<br />
television series.</p>
<p>This is how paradigm shifts work. The above companies tried to build<br />
modest businesses in not-too-contested corner of the market place. The<br />
paradigm starts shifting in their favor and they find themselves<br />
capturing more surplus than they know what to do with. They slowly wake<br />
up to the realization that they are at the top of the pyramid —<br />
not by any strategic brilliance of their own, but rather, because the<br />
pyramid shifted and contorted itself and they happened to be at the<br />
right coordinates at the right time. Western Europe provides an<br />
interesting case study —  the place was a backwater far away from<br />
any action until some adventerous sailors and navigators found sea<br />
routes to Asia(that let them by-pass the Eastern Mediteranean<br />
middle-men) and to the Americas(which would eventually house the worlds<br />
most successful and likely last ever hegemon —  as always, every<br />
paradigm contains the seeds of its own destruction,).</p>

        <span>New paradigm</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Different people have different ideas about what the next paradigm of<br />
the web is. Web2.0 got us half-way to where we want to be. Its pioneers,<br />
however, could not resist the incentives to maximize the proportion of<br />
the economic surplus that they capture —  even though these Web2.0<br />
business are essentially <em>built by the users</em>. And Web3.0? Depends on<br />
who you ask. Right now the mainstream thinks that Web3.0 is the<br />
<em>semantic web</em> —  a decades-old idea that has always struggled to<br />
gain traction. Meanwhile, an increasing number of people believe that<br />
Web3.0 will center around <em>blockchain technologies</em> —  but they<br />
call it <strong>web3</strong>(we will call it Web3.0 from now on in this paper).</p>
<p>We believe that the new paradigm for the internet/web is<br />
hyper-decentralization. The web is decentralizing the media and the news<br />
and the publishing industry. The web is decentralizing geography —<br />
two people a million miles away can interact with each other over<br />
video-chat or VR. The web is decentralizing finance —  even stuffy<br />
old banks want to get in on the DeFi bandwagon. The web is<br />
decentralizing the nation-state —  people often times have more in<br />
common with globally dispersed like-minded individuals than their fellow<br />
neighbors and citizens. The web is decentralizing employment —<br />
the number of people working in the gig-economy and the creator-economy<br />
is increasing(unfortunately this is another example of users creating a<br />
surplus that is captured by online equivalent of a few feudal lords).</p>
<p>We believe that this accelerating trend of hyper-decentralization will<br />
also decentralize the parts of the web that have to do with <em>trust</em>.<br />
Right now, the intermediary institutions (i.e. Facebook, Twitter,<br />
Reddit, HN, and so on) that ascribe credibility and trustworthiness do<br />
so in ways that are <em>opaque</em>. We do not know <em>why</em> certain tweets appear<br />
in our feeds and others do not —  and even if we did, there is<br />
nothing we can do <em>customize</em> our feed(aside from following/unfollowing<br />
various accounts). We can see a Reddit user&#x27;s karma-score as well as the<br />
score of their individual posts —  which is slightly less opaque<br />
than Hacker News&#x27;s ranking system —  but we cannot see <em>who</em><br />
up-voted or down-voted that user&#x27;s posts. In fact, we have no way of<br />
knowing if that karma score has not been accidentally inflated by a<br />
random bit-flip on Reddit&#x27;s servers —  let alone if it has been<br />
manipulated by an insider or inflated by a voting ring. Similar logic<br />
applies to Twitter and Hacker News. Hacker News has surprisingly<br />
insightful discussions, in spite of its concealment of vote-metadata for<br />
posts, but it is still suseptible to insider manipulation and voting<br />
rings. Finally, there is the question of whether a single raw integer<br />
—  whether it represents total karma or total followers or total<br />
likes or total retweets —  can <em>actually</em> capture the<br />
trustworthiness, truthfulness, and popularity of an account and the<br />
content associated with it. Can you determine if someone is going to be<br />
a good and helpful friend or collaborator by the size of their wallet?</p>

        <span>Intro: Three strains of economic thought</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Before we continue with our proposed solution, we should probably take a<br />
brief detour into economics-land and express how our proposal fits into<br />
the main frameworks of economics. From the late 1700s up to the<br />
present-day three economic schools of thought have shaped societies<br />
around the world —  namely, the Neoclassical, the Keynesian, and<br />
the Marxian. The Neoclassical school focused on individual freedom and<br />
individual incentives, and rejected any form of state-intervention in<br />
the economy —  in other words they assumed that Utopia was<br />
achievable without Leviathan. After the Great Depression set the<br />
Neoclassical Utopia aflame, the Keynesian school arose and argued that a<br />
Utopia could not be maintained without a Leviathan —  they argued<br />
that the individual was certainly important, but not nearly as important<br />
as the <em>structure</em> of the economy. These two views correspond to<br />
microeconomics (i.e.  reasoning that individuals ruthlessly purseuing<br />
their own self-interest will create the most desirable outcomes for all<br />
of humanity) and macroeconomics (i.e. reasoning that <em>tracking</em><br />
macroeconomic indicators like GDP, unemployment, inflation, and<br />
interest-rates and <em>tuning</em> those macroeconomic variables will create<br />
the most desirable outcomes for all of humanity). Put differently, one<br />
school thinks that individual behavior and actions <em>cause</em> the economy,<br />
while the other school thinks that the economy <em>causes</em> individual<br />
actions and behavior. To be clear, we are not taking sides, both points<br />
of view are correct they just disagree about the <em>relative</em> value of one<br />
component in relation to the others. And now onto the Marxian school<br />
which requires its own paragraph.</p>
<p>The Marxians are primarily concerned with <em>the means of production</em><br />
—  specifically, what they are, who is the class that owns them,<br />
who is the class that operates them, what are their outputs, what is<br />
their economic surplus, and who captures what proportion of that<br />
surplus.  They marvel at the economic efficiency and dynamism unlocked<br />
by the transition from feudalism to capitalism, but they believe that<br />
any arrangement in which the class that operates the means of production<br />
but does not own or control those means is fundementally unjust, and<br />
does not fulfil the(false) promises of Humanism(the philosophy<br />
undergirding both Neoclassical and Keynesian social orders). They also<br />
believe that individuals and economic-structures are always shaping<br />
each-other via a never-ending <em>dialectics</em> —  in effect, they are<br />
<em>simultaneously</em> cause <em>and</em> effect. And that is pretty much all of the<br />
Marxian school <em>that is relevant to this paper</em> —  there is a lot<br />
of other stuff (i.e. central planning as a suitable alternative to the<br />
market) that is simply not compatible with a globalized marketplace, nor<br />
is it compatible with a trend towards hyper-decentralization.</p>
<p>We basically agree with all of these theories, and want to use the three<br />
perspectives to construct a globally decentralized network that will<br />
give users freedom, control, privacy, and security.</p>

<p>Trying to eliminate the intermediary institutions that ascribe trust is<br />
a little bit like trying to eliminate the police or trying to eliminate<br />
schools. Obviously policing and schooling are very important and nobody<br />
would ever consider decentralizing them, let alone eliminating them. So<br />
should ask ourselves, what kind of a people have no need for the police?<br />
What kind of people have no need for schools? The answer, dear reader,<br />
is people that are <em>self-policing</em> and <em>self-schooling</em>. Obviously, such<br />
people are very rare, otherwise we would not need schools and police<br />
departments. However, a computer that is not under the control of any<br />
single individual can in fact be used to implement this kind of flawless<br />
self-regulation. If we go back to that earlier Runescape example from<br />
Section 4, the game could have been programmed to disallow such acts of<br />
deception —  whether this makes the game better is another matter<br />
entirely.</p>
<p>What we wish to do is to use the decentralized, history preserving, and<br />
transactional nature of the blockchain to implement an anonymous<br />
trust-network. To be clear, we are <strong>not</strong> trying to replace existing<br />
platforms like Reddit or Twitter —  this is <strong>not</strong> <em>XYZ But for<br />
The Blockchain</em>. We do think that blockchain technology will see<br />
adoption in content-creation and content-distribution, but we think that<br />
those domains are related but separate from the domain of <em>trust and<br />
reputation</em>.</p>
<p>Our network associates users with accounts on the blockchain, similar to<br />
how a licence plate is associated with a vehicle —  though<br />
<em>unlike</em> a license plate we do not associate the <em>identity</em> of the user<br />
with the account. Each account has a certain number of <code v-pre>Inter Tokens</code><br />
associated with it. These coins are <strong>not</strong> a measure of karma or<br />
trustworthiness —  rather, they are merely a way to amplify (i.e.<br />
upvote) or dampen (i.e. downvote) other accounts. The network does not<br />
<em>score</em> anything —  it merely records the upvotes and downvotes,<br />
which account they came from, and how many Vote Tokens(more on this<br />
later) have been spent on each upvote or downvote. The idea is that,<br />
voting is not free. When a upvotes they are depositing a percentage of<br />
those votes into the target account —  when downvoting, no votes<br />
get deducted from the target account but the downvote-transaction does<br />
get recorded on the blockchain(we do not want users with an overwhelming<br />
amount of vote-tokens to be able to bankrupt accounts that they<br />
dislike). Users can also <em>vouch</em> for other accounts. Vouching is a<br />
special kind of upvote —  it allows a user to risk a certain<br />
amount of their vote-tokens to give another user visibility. If the<br />
other user gets upvotes then the upvotes are recorded on the blockchain,<br />
but the vote-tokens are shared between the voucher(s) and the vouchee in<br />
proportion to how much vote-tokens all of these users have vouched. If<br />
the other user gets downvotes then the voucher loses a proportional<br />
amount of vote-tokens —  so one should not vouch blindly. Vouching<br />
can be time-limited, and the vouchee has to explicitly accept the vouch.<br />
Lastly users can <em>share</em>. Sharing essentially lets a user post an<br />
arbitrary byte-string to the blockchain —  the network charges a<br />
<strong>significant</strong> per-byte fee for sharing. The reasoning is that we want<br />
to incentivize users to post <em>links and URLs</em> to content on other more<br />
mainstream platforms, instead of <em>actual</em> content which we consider<br />
outside of our scope. This essentially allows accounts to act as<br />
<em>curation feeds</em>.</p>
<p>As for the actual <em>scoring</em>, we decentralize this by pushing it to the<br />
<em>edges</em> of the network. The idea is that users can run a scoring program<br />
that will walk the blockchain and build a graph of accounts as connected<br />
by upvotes, downvotes, and vouches —  in effect applying a kind of<br />
page-rank algorithm to account. The reason we outsource this to the<br />
client is that it allows people to build things like feeds in a totally<br />
custom way. For example users can play around with <em>biased</em> page-ranks<br />
(i.e. what would happen if we removed Account XYZ from the blockchain<br />
history, or what would happen if we treat these 5 accounts as a single<br />
shared account). The possibilities are endless. What would a feed look<br />
like if Account X was <em>my</em> account? Which accounts have voted for my<br />
account(s)? Which accounts have a similar voting pattern to mine?</p>
<p>Each account is associated with a public cryptographic key. Users can<br />
sign things that they post on the web (i.e. to reddit or to their own<br />
blog), so that users of the Interlock Network can know that the content<br />
was posted by somebody that they trust.</p>
<p>If the Interlock Network sees wider adoption, website admins can include<br />
a custom HTTP header that includes a signed Interlock Network account<br />
number —  if a user has installed a Interlock-Network-aware<br />
browser-extension they can automatically inspect that account&#x27;s history<br />
and various rankings, interactions, and scores. Years ago, Paul Graham<br />
said that he asked applicants to Y Combinator provide their Hacker News<br />
account-name as an additional data-point for YC to consider when<br />
evaluating the applicants and their proposals —  we believe that<br />
the Interlock Network can be used in a similar capacity, <em>but across the<br />
entire internet</em>. Everything from online stores to online gaming<br />
communities can make use of the data stored in the Interlock Network to<br />
ascertain the trustworthiness of the participants. Even in the domain of<br />
startups, companies with a good reputation on the Interlock Network can<br />
offer their employees Inter Tokens or upvotes in lieu of stock or<br />
shares.</p>
<p>If Web2.0 was about <em>websites</em> and <em>services</em>, we believe that Web3.0 is<br />
about <em>people</em> and <em>content</em> and their <em>trustworthiness</em>.</p>

<p>An interesting application of the Interlock Network would be as a way to<br />
implement a <em>favor exchange</em>. Think of it this way —  you want<br />
someone to do you a favor (i.e. you want them to farm potato-cactuses on<br />
Runescape) so you give them an NFT Inter Token and they do you a solid<br />
favor. Now that the favor is complete, the favor-doer has an NFT token<br />
that is directly linked to you that indicates that <em>you</em> owe <em>them</em> a<br />
favor. Once you do them a favor, they will give you a corresponding NFT<br />
token that will cancel out your original token. The cool thing about<br />
this, is that it encourages the development of long-lived bilateral<br />
relationships between accounts and people —  whereas the exchange<br />
of money generally encourages us to treat other human beings as<br />
vending-machines that do things for us because we we inserted money into<br />
them. Clearly it is possible for the two users to never reach an<br />
agreement on whether a favor was ever actually completed, in which case<br />
the NFT can be reclaimed by the issuer —  whether or not this is<br />
true is not nearly as important as it being permanently recorded on the<br />
blockchain, and the page-rank algorithm can do its magic.</p>

<p>Security is a difficult problem —  it has <em>always</em> been a<br />
difficult problem. Throwing blockchain at the problem won&#x27;t<br />
automatically fix it. If websites were signed using a Interlock Network<br />
account-signature many phishing attacks —  the most common and<br />
most successful kind of attack —  would be a lot less feasible.<br />
However, Interlock Network does not yet exist —  and even if it<br />
did it would only protect the users that have an account on it from<br />
websites that belong to <em>other</em> users that have an account on it. So<br />
while the Interlock Network concept has enormous potential and could be<br />
an extremely powerful security mechanism —  if widely used and<br />
adopted —  it is not a good starting point.</p>
<p>Our company, Interlock, has developed an extension —  a fork of<br />
uBlock —  that, in addition to the usual ad-blocking functions,<br />
can also detect whether a website is fraudulent based on very effective,<br />
widely tested, heuristics. When a user opens a webpage that the<br />
extension thinks is fraudulent or untrustworthy, the extension will<br />
prevent any user input to the page and issue a warning in the form of a<br />
large red banner. The extension has already seen use in some large<br />
companies that you have definitely heard of —  and for most of its<br />
life it has been out of the reach of non-corporate users. Our plan is to<br />
make this extension available to <em>everyone</em> but to modify it to work<br />
with Interlock Network. When the user installs the extension they can<br />
open an account on the Interlock Network, link it to the extension, and<br />
we will deposite some amount of Inter Tokens into their account. As they<br />
use the extension they will get a variable-time and variable-quantity<br />
reward for using it.  They can also get additional Inter Tokens if they<br />
verify that a link dangerous —  though this is opt-in as it would<br />
require us to request that verification from a random subset of users<br />
that are not too tightly connected on the Interlock Network. The<br />
extension will also be extended to allow sharing of links from the<br />
browser on the Interlock Network. Users can also flag webpages as either<br />
being malicious or <em>containing</em> malicious content (i.e. a comment on<br />
reddit or a video on youtube). And finally the extension can also be<br />
used to explore the data stored in the Interlock Network.</p>
<p>Naturally, we encourage the community to create alternative extensions.<br />
For example an extension that mimics the old StumbleUpon extension would<br />
be very cool to see. Also an extension that mimics the functionality of<br />
Google Reader, but for Interlock Network shares rather than actual RSS<br />
feeds.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The <strong>Know Your Customer</strong> laws are an interesting example of laws that<br />
require establishing the trustworthiness of a customer. In principle it<br />
is much the same concept as checking whether a website is legitimate or<br />
fraudulent or whether an account on the Interlock Network is highly<br />
regarded or shunned. Obviously, if all transactions happened on the<br />
Interlock Network —  or on <em>any</em> blockchain —  KYC laws<br />
would be trivial to implement. That is one of the nice side effects of<br />
complete transparency. We can combine the data on the Interlock Network<br />
with data —  <em>anonymized</em> of course —  that we gather from<br />
the extension to help the relevant Web3.0 financial institutions (i.e.<br />
namely crypto-exchanges and banks that want jump onto the DeFi train)<br />
stay in compliance with the KYC regulations.</p>

<p>To back our smart-contracts and our token we have chosen the <strong>Solana</strong><br />
blockchain technology as our platform. This platform has addressed many<br />
of the outstanding problems found in similar popular blockchains like<br />
Ethereum (i.e. transaction-speed energy-efficiency<br />
infinite-smart-contract-loops etc). That said, we are always on the<br />
lookout for new and improved technologies that can help us achieve our<br />
goals. We are especially aware of the compromise that proof-of-stake<br />
solutions have made with regards to decentralization. We hope to see<br />
—  and use —  newer blockchains that are even more<br />
peer-to-peer than the current batch. With regards to that last point,<br />
proof-of-space-time seems like a promising development and we hope to<br />
see more of those kinds of developments in the future —  the whole<br />
point, after all, is to prevent or least mitigate the centralization of<br />
power and authority into the hands of those who can throw enormous sums<br />
of money at a problem (i.e. governments mega-corporations and even some<br />
classes of criminals and syndicates).</p>
<p>To be honest, we are still not 100 percent certain that Solana is going<br />
to be able to implement all of the features that we desire for the<br />
Interlock Network to have. Worst case, we will have to implement our own<br />
blockchain from scratch —  we are still evaluating options. At<br />
minimum we will use Solana as a test-bed for the basic idea and move on<br />
from there.</p>
<p>We have also taken a look at the Elrond and Algorand blockchains, and we<br />
were pretty impressed. At the moment, neither of these can really match<br />
Solana&#x27;s raw transaction rate, and they are also not as composable as<br />
Solana. However, we do not expect this situation to last forever —<br />
so we will be keeping an eye on these other two chains because they are<br />
seeing increasing adoption from large financial(and governmental)<br />
entities that are not Silicon Valley VC&#x27;s.</p>

<p>Just wanted to circle back to the three economic paradigms mentioned<br />
earlier. The Interlock Network satifies both the<br />
neoclassical-individualist and keynesian-structuralist perspectives<br />
because we can infer a very precise <em>structure</em> from the recorded<br />
transaction-history between <em>individuals</em> —  in fact if the<br />
Interlock Network gains wide adoption it would probably be of<br />
significant interest to all kinds of economists and sociologists.<br />
Furthermore we have tried to the design the incentives encourage<br />
pro-social use of the blockchain —  but of course if any<br />
economists(or non-economists) want to chime in then please go ahead. As<br />
for the marxians, they can take pleasure in the fact that (a) the user&#x27;s<br />
privacy, relationships, and attention (i.e. the means of production for<br />
the information age) are owned by the collective and not by people whose<br />
names rhyme with Stark Truckerberg or Track Horsey and (b) the user has<br />
the final say over which accounts are more attention-worthy than others.</p>

<p>We have given you a short overview and justification of which blockchain<br />
will be used as a test-bed for the Interlock Network, now we will give<br />
some concrete details about how this will be implemented on top of<br />
Solana. So far, we have spoken of the Interlock Network as if it was a<br />
proper stand-alone blockchain, so that we can get the <em>idea</em> of a P2P<br />
reputation network across to you. However, there are some significant<br />
implementation details that diverge from our <em>idealized description</em> of<br />
the Interlock Network, in the previous sections.</p>
<p>Pretty much all software that runs on a blockchain is going to be much<br />
slower —  and more expensive —  than traditional software<br />
that runs on raw silicon(or even in a VM). We should start with the good<br />
news —  transactions in Solana are extremely cheap, costing only<br />
about 10-USD to execute a <em>million</em> transactions. The <em>bad</em> news is that<br />
per-account storage is severely limited and severely expensive. On<br />
Solana each account can only store a maximum 10MB of data —  which<br />
is not enough for our history-based reputation scoring —  and each<br />
MB costs 3.56 SOL to store per year —  which comes out to<br />
10MB-years costing 1200-USD at the current SOL-USD exchange ratio(1 SOL<br />
is worth 33 to 34 USD). Storing data directly on the Solana blockchain<br />
is not feasible. Other blockchains do allow storing of <em>more</em> data than<br />
Solana but storing this data still has pretty steep costs (i.e. writing<br />
1MB of data to Ethereum costs a staggering 76-USD one-time-fee).</p>
<p>As a result of these economic realities, we will use Solana as a P2P<br />
transaction processor —  but not as a storage engine. Instead, we<br />
will use Solana&#x27;s WebSocket API to listen for transaction-notifications<br />
that involve our Interlock Network smart-contracts. These notifications<br />
—  which are basically transaction logs —  will be stored in<br />
the Postgres-based timeseries database called TimescaleDB. We will make<br />
this DB publically readable —  but rate-limited, for economic<br />
reasons. Full archives of the DB will be made available weekly via<br />
BitTorrent(or something with similar or better properties —  we<br />
are keeping an eye of Storj and related technologies) so that users of<br />
Interlock Network can query this data locally, with minimal latency, and<br />
with minimal API fees. It is our goal to make this data —  these<br />
transaction logs —  the property of the <em>entire internet</em> and not<br />
just a single company. We should also note that <em>anybody</em> can snoop on<br />
the JSON RPC API that Solana exposes and build their own data-base<br />
—  so there is no danger of Interlock drawing up the bridge and<br />
charging exorbitant fees on a whim. The reason that we offer an API and<br />
a BitTorrent archive is that the Solana API has a limited retention<br />
period.  Our understanding is that retention can be configured on a<br />
per-validator basis —  so some validators might have more or less<br />
transanction-history than others. The only way for Interlock to have the<br />
full history is to run our own validator —  which certainly sounds<br />
like fun —  but that would be overkill because we only care about<br />
a tiny subset of the millions of transactions that happen on the Solana<br />
blockchain. By providing a public API and distributing an archive we are<br />
making it possible for people to see, and verify, the complete Interlock<br />
Network history.</p>
<p>As for the smart-contracts themselves, our plan is to implement a single<br />
smart-contract <em>per verb</em>. As discussed previously, there are only a<br />
handful of verbs —  <em>upvote</em>, <em>downvote</em>, <em>vouch</em>, <em>share</em>, and<br />
<em>quid-pro-quo</em>. Each verb is basically its own smart-contract and takes<br />
an account number as an argument. The account invoking the verb pays for<br />
the cost of the transaction —  which is measured in thousandths of<br />
a SOL —  as well as a tiny and negligible percentage to an<br />
interlock-owned account —  this is to help fund the development of<br />
the Interlock Network and other related interlock products. The verbs<br />
upvote, downvote, and vouch are pretty straight forward to implement<br />
since they just manipulate balances and store no data. Implementing<br />
<em>share</em> however, is a bit more of a challenge because of the high<br />
storage-fees on Solana. When the share-program is invoked, it is done<br />
via a transaction, which contains opaque 8-bit instruction-data. This<br />
instruction data is <em>thrown away</em> by the share-program as soon as it<br />
gets it —  however, WebSocket listeners will <em>snatch</em> all the<br />
metadata about the transaction including the 8-bit instruction-data, <em>so<br />
it is not lost</em>. If the data is longer than <em>560 bytes</em> our <em>share<br />
program</em> will emit an error and our listeners will <em>ignore</em> the<br />
transaction — 560 bytes is enough to encode meaningful meta-data<br />
about content (i.e. a link along with perhaps a checksum of some kind).<br />
The <em>share</em> smart-contract will charge a one-time per-byte fee to<br />
incentivize users to keep their shared content as short as possible<br />
—  and to disincentivize the spamming of our database.</p>
<p>The <em>quit-pro-quo program</em> is very similar to the <em>upvote</em> program,<br />
except it mints and deposits an account-specific NFT that cannot be<br />
withdrawn or spent by the receiving account —  see the previous<br />
section, <em>quid pro quo</em>, for more details.</p>

<p>Since we are already talking about Solana and architecture, it seems<br />
natural to segue into the tokenomics of our Inter Token currency. Most<br />
tokens and cryptocurrencies like to make guarantees about the maximum<br />
supply of their tokens. We feel that having to choose between inflation<br />
and deflation is a false dichotamy. We clearly want to make use of the<br />
century of brainpower that went into monetary theory and the<br />
more-than-half-century of brain-power that went into<br />
game-theory(specifically the subfield of mechanism design) to create<br />
both long-term and short-term incentives that will encourage pro-social<br />
behaviour and participation on the interlock network.</p>
<p>We want people to vote, but we also want them to vote thoughtfully<br />
—  to that end votes are emphatically <strong>not</strong> free. They cost<br />
Inter Token. We also do not want people to hoard Inter Tokens, because<br />
that means that they are not voting. This is why we actually have<br />
different <em>flavors</em> of Inter Token. The vanilla Inter Token is like any<br />
other token that can be bought and traded. But we also air-drop a<br />
vote-only flavor of Inter Token these coins are only good for voting<br />
—  except for the occaisional token-swap in which an account can<br />
exchange their vote-only tokens for the actual Inter Token. A vote-token<br />
is either spent or unspent —  if unspent it is not exchangable. In<br />
other words, when a user votes they transfer their unspent token to the<br />
account that they voted for, but their <em>own</em> account receives a <em>spent</em><br />
token that cannot be used for anything —  except buying Inter<br />
Token. This is very much like Japan&#x27;s policy of <em>Window Guidance</em><br />
—  except we are guiding voting behaviour, instead corporate<br />
behaviour.</p>
<p>Voting activity is obviously done via its own tokens, but what about<br />
sharing? We feel that sharing should be billed directly in Inter Token.<br />
Unlike voting, where we do not wish people to hoard their votes, sharing<br />
is a little different. We certainly want people to share, but we do not<br />
want them to <em>spam</em> our DB with <em>noise</em>. For example, at 560 bytes and<br />
200 billion —  the number of yearly tweets processed by twitter at<br />
time of writing —  shares per year, the Interlock Network accounts<br />
would be generating 101 TB of data per year. That is a <em>lot</em> of data to<br />
store, index, mirror, and distribute —  we want to make every byte<br />
count, specifically so that ordinary users can feasibly do their own<br />
mirroring and querying. This state of affairs does give users with more<br />
Inter Tokens (i.e. because of more received upvotes or because they<br />
purchased more) a bit of a social edge. We are not entirely sure if that<br />
is a good thing or bad thing. We have considered various policies, such<br />
as distributing the share-costs across the entire network as a<br />
<em>percentage</em>, or at least doubling the per-byte fee <em>with each new<br />
share</em> —  on a per account-basis —  so that accounts can<br />
share cheaply at least once a day, but they cannot firehose every random<br />
brainwave onto the network. The former policy might incentivize<br />
account-owners to engage in complex behaviors akin to tax-evasion and<br />
capital-flight. The latter policy seems more sensible and equitable, but<br />
this is one those things that will probably require extensive<br />
experimentation, before we can accept it as a <em>good idea</em>. We suspect<br />
that the economics of sharing will motivate people to post a handful of<br />
links to things like their blogs, personal-websites, twitter-accounts,<br />
github-accounts, and aggregators using those specialized platforms for<br />
sharing, in order to avoid paying for something that the Web can provide<br />
for free. This possible outcome suits us just fine, as it creates a high<br />
signal-to-noise ratio —  which is exactly what we are after.</p>

<p>To facilitate investment in the project we are going to pursue a DAICO<br />
model. The idea behind the model is that investors can invest a specific<br />
amount of SOL into an investment-fund account for the Interlock project.<br />
This account has a monthly limit on withdrawals and any withdrawals<br />
beyond that limit would have to be voted on by the investors. A fixed<br />
number of SOL can be invested (i.e. the target number) and investors<br />
cannot exceed a maximum-proportion(which is <strong>five percent</strong> of the<br />
target number). Investors have voting-power which is proportional to the<br />
amount that they have invested. Each new round of investment will be a<br />
new DAICO involving a different investment-account and the same —<br />
or slightly tweaked —  smart-contract to manage those funds. The<br />
presence of multiple and unlimited rounds is to give new investors an<br />
opportunity to participate fairly and equitably in the project. The<br />
presence of proportion-limits is to ensure (a) a minimum number of<br />
investors (i.e. 20) and (b) that no single investor has unilateral veto<br />
power during a vote. Investors will also receive ownership over accounts<br />
with a proportional amount of Voting Inter Tokens as well a normal Inter<br />
Tokens. Each investor will also receive upvotes from upvotes from the<br />
Interlock Team as a form of symbolic thanks.</p>
<p>For this to work correctly, we will have to break away from our theme of<br />
privacy and anonymity —  allowing anonymous investors would be the<br />
same as allowing any investor to invest a proportion larger than 5<br />
percent, which defeats the purpose. Additionally, allowing anonymous<br />
investors might interfere with KYC laws. Though, we can probably<br />
experiment with fully anonymous rounds for smaller investment targets<br />
(i.e. a few dozen thousand dollars).</p>
<p>We are also interested in trying to raise fund on Solstarter when that<br />
platform is ready —  but until they launch, we will have to go<br />
with the DAICO model. <strong>We will update this section with details for how<br />
the inaugural DAICO round will be run soon</strong>.</p>

        <span>Technical contribution</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Regarding technical contribution we will follow an RFD/RFC model where<br />
project design documents are proposed and discussed on various community<br />
channels (i.e. github, discord, and others). If the project and<br />
community get large enough we will likely adopt a governance model akin<br />
to Rust&#x27;s.  We diverge from the traditional RFC process in that we (a)<br />
adopt proposals by voting via smart-contract and (b) developers can show<br />
their support and affinity for each-other and their ideas by using the<br />
upvote/downvote mechanism that is already in place. We do not require<br />
separete personal and developer accounts, but we also do not require the<br />
same account. Keeping with the theme of privacy and anonymity a<br />
developer can have as many accounts as they want and the<br />
project/community would have no way of knowing —  which is<br />
<em>already</em> the situation in the real world (i.e. one can make as many<br />
github accounts as they want).  Voting is consensus-driven —<br />
proposals require unanimous approval.  Unanimous consensus is meant to<br />
eliminate the competitive nature of voting —  all disagreements<br />
should be resolved at the <em>discussion</em> phase before a proposal comes to<br />
a vote. We believe that there are very few <em>true</em> and <em>unresolvable</em><br />
contradictions in engineering. Proposals can be resubmitted for voting.</p>
<p>Each technical contributor is given an NFT that allows them to vote.<br />
Each technical contributor must explicitly refresh their NFT every 30<br />
days otherwise it gets burned. The idea is that if a contributor drops<br />
off the grid, their absence will not cause the system to lock-up. The<br />
Interlock Team can always issue new NFT&#x27;s to contributors returning from<br />
a hiatus.  The Interlock Team can also burn the NFT&#x27;s of anybody who has<br />
not contributed any code in the previous 300 days —  we have not<br />
found a way to enforce this via smart-contract so the process is, at the<br />
moment, manual.</p>
