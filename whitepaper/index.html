<p>The web requires <em>trust</em> between many participants to reach its fullest
potential. However, the participants have centralized the trust-rating function to a
handful of gatekeepers, who themselves have questionable credibility and
competence. We propose a solution that uses blockchain and other
technologies to increase security, privacy, and trust and bypasses those
gatekeepers.</p>

<p>The thing about these kinds of papers — whitepapers — is
that they are supposed to be confident, authoritative, and seductive.
Why, we hear you ask? Because stringing together words that create an
impression of authoritative and seductive confidence is what often
convinces people to buy whatever it is you are selling. Everybody wants to
invest in the impossible-to-miss certain-to-win solution to some problem
that the market has. We have gone through a lot of whitepapers written
with the confidence and certainty of a devout missionary seeking
converts and, of course, donors. We are not going to do that to you.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, we <em>are</em> trying to <em>convince</em> you of the merits of our
vision and idea — we just have no interest in <em>hypnotizing</em> you
into agreeing with us. If you believe that the Web is not living up to
its founding promises — and you want to change this — then
please read on.</p>

<p>The writers of this paper, fellow traveler, are old enough to remember
the following: napster, gnutella, bit-torrent, Usenet, slashdot, RSS
Feeds, Tor, Google before it became evil, and Open Source before it
became cool. We remember an internet where nobody knew that you were a
dog — and, more importantly, nobody cared. We remember when being
social on the internet meant that you had a blog, read (and shared files
on) USENET, and participated in Slashdot discussions and flame-wars as
an &#x27;Anonymous Coward&#x27;. We remember that being informed meant that you
used Google Reader, RIP, to read RSS feeds which were
absolutely everywhere. And if you <em>really</em> wanted to stick it to
The Man, you installed Linux on your second-hand beige-box and Firefox
on your folks&#x27; Windows computer — we still have vivid memories and
strong feelings about MSFT, and quite a bit of residual PTSD and mental
scar-tissue. But, somewhere along the way the internet took a turn. Now
people use Facebook instead of USENET, Twitter instead of RSS, and
Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify instead of BitTorrent. Also, USENET,
Slashdot, and friends are all ghost-towns — while their nearest
equivalents have been overrun by trolls, cat-pictures, memes,
advertisers, and cybercriminals. Oh, and Microsoft is an increasingly
popular and increasingly open-source company — which is as
inconceivable as Ghengis Khan becoming an exemplary Red Cross volunteer.</p>
<p>Clearly, there has been a pendulum swing from a decentralized and
democratic internet to one that is significantly more centralized and
autocratic. A significant driver of this centralization has been the
insight that the majority of people are busy enough that they will give
up control for convenience — especially if that convenience has a
price-tag approaching <em>zero</em>. With the increase in convenience, things
like web-pages and blogs could be created by people who did not know how
to program or administer computers. Even if you did have this
skill-set, chances are you would apply it to a <em>virtual</em> computer in the
<em>cloud</em> rather than a physical one in your closet. This centralization
of computing was not sinister or evil — far from it — but it
was, rather paradoxically, a leap towards making the web accessible and
useful to more people than ever before. In other words, centralization
<em>did</em> democratize <em>participation</em> in the web, but it came at the expense
of freedom, control, and privacy. The web that you see today, is the web
that Google wants you to see when you use their search, that Facebook,
Twitter, and Instagram want you to see when you scroll through &#x27;your&#x27;
feed. And what they want you to see, is whatever will make you re-share
the content or click on an advertisement. You are, in effect, plugged
into The Matrix — the entire cyberpunk oeuvre is not merely
dystopic fiction, it is part prophesy and part warning.</p>
<p>Maybe you are thinking, that does not sound so bad — maybe we
<em>have</em> to sacrifice freedom, control, and privacy to democratize
participation in the web. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe that is <em>exactly</em> what
the feudal Serfs were thinking while they were working the fields of
their lords — maybe we have to sacrifice control over our bodies,
our labor, and the (literal) fruits of that labor to democratize
participation in agriculture. After all, what is the alternative?
Starvation?</p>
<p>We sympathize, fellow traveler. We sympathize with you, because it is a
perfectly reasonable question to ask. Yes, being excluded and isolated
from the means of production of our era, is infinitely worse than having
our every action tracked, classified, and monetized. But unlike the
quarries, mines, farms, plantations, factories, and refineries of
previous eras — which all required capital to establish and
maintain and upgrade — the means of production of <em>our</em> era is,
well, <strong>us</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you post on reddit? <em>You</em> are creating the value, <em>they</em> are
capturing it. Do you make videos for YouTube? <em>You</em> are creating the
value, <em>they</em> are capturing it. Do you create content for OnlyFans?
<em>You</em> are creating the value, <em>they</em> are capturing it.</p>
<p><em>They</em> conceive of a world where they data-mine — yes, the
exploitative nature of their business models is even reflected in their
<em>jargon</em>  — everything we do, turn that data into money, and <em>we</em>
get (basically imaginary) shares, retweets, mentions, likes,
so-called-friends, and so-called-followers. They have even removed
negative actions such as dislikes for fear that it will drive users
— another revealing bit of jargon — away. Their mission is to
keep us happy and cheerful while we (happily and cheerfully) make them
money. You know who also does this? Farmers. What does that make <em>us</em>?
Livestock. Are you tired of being milked yet?</p>

        <span>It Gets Worse</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The previous section was a little bleak — we will give you that.
But — as you can probably surmise from this section&#x27;s title
— this paper is going to get bleaker before it gets brighter.</p>
<p>If the end of the previous section has you feeling like you have been
conned, like you are — sooner or later — going to be the eventual victim
of an unsustainable and tenuous pyramid scheme, well, that was our
intent. To be clear, we are not trying to scare you with ghost stories.
We <em>wish</em> these were just ghost stories — the exaggerations of a
handful of nerds, hackers, and cypherpunks trying to shock you into
listening. But the pyramid is built on a shaky foundation and the
dangers are real.</p>
<p>How could it get worse? Well, in addition to being exploited, and
metaphorically robbed, by the feudal lords of the internet, you are also
being exploited, and <em>literally</em> robbed, by the scammers and criminals
that have a growing presence on the internet. We have a multitude of
delightful statistics that back up this claim. The areas of cybercrime,
fraud, and identity-theft are so ripe and pregnant with opportunities
that even nation-states are eager to get in on it — and they are
not even trying to conceal their involvment. Yes, they give <em>zero</em>
fucks, because they are confident that the majority of the populace is
too distracted and too impoverished to actually — in the words of
Morpheus — <em>wake up</em>.</p>
<p>The obvious question is, why are there so many scammers and
cybercriminals. What is there to steal? Is it worth the risk? What are
the risks? Well, the modern cybercriminal is not like a bank-robber or
hostage-taker. The bank-robber or hostage-taker uses coercion and
intimidation to steal money. The modern cybercriminal is more like the
mythical japanese creature <em>noppera-bo</em>. This creature is a faceless
ghost that steals the faces of humans. Cybercrime is about stealing
people&#x27;s faces and using them as masks — it is about <em>deception</em>
more than it is about coercion or violence. The faces in this metaphor
are usually authentication-credentials that may lead the criminal to
their ultimate goal, currency, crypto or otherwise.</p>
<p>And that is just the most obvious form of theft; material theft.
Once business, politics, and religion enter the equation, lines and
categories start to get blurry very fast. For example, can <em>truth</em> be
stolen? If so, does that make a flat-earther a criminal? What about the
corporate marketing department that uses flawed benchmarking
methodologies to convince you that their product is superior to the
competition? What about alternative or traditional medicine books? What
about the <em>hundreds</em> of pseudo-historical, pseudo-scientific, and
pseudo-sociological narratives that are weaved every election cycle to
convince people that their neighbors and fellow citizens are the cause
of their anguish — rather than the massive institutions,
corporations, and beaurocracies that have every incentive to profit from
and perpetrate anguish and tragedy across continents and across
generations (you do not have to look further than McDonalds and
Phillip-Morris)?</p>
<p>The point is, the truth is very important, but it can be hard to pin
down. Very few things can be considered absolute truths. The web —
under its current commercialized and oligarchic stewardship —
perpetuates, exacerbates, and profits from vanity, greed, delusion,
ignorance, envy, hatred, and outrage. Instead, it should give users the
tools to better understand themselves, human nature, and our
connectedness to all things — an ancient idea that is in fact more
relevant to the modern world than it ever was to the ancient world.</p>
<p>Criminals and tech corporations both see the internet-user as something
to be exploited. The former seeks to attack and corrupt the state of
your bank account, while the latter seeks to attack and corrupt your
state of mind. You will find it easy, even effortless, to be angry with
the former, but you may find it difficult to be angry with the latter.
You cannot be angry with the tobacco company for selling you
exactly what you asked for.</p>

<p>Before 1971, if you held a dollar in your hand and examined what was
written on it, you would see &#x27;Exchangeable for Gold&#x27;. After 1971, it
would only say &#x27;In God We Trust&#x27;. We used to believe in the dollar
because we believed in gold — now we believe in the dollar
because we believe in the dollar. This is what some historians would
call a revolution, others would call it a <em>paradigm shift</em>. Paradigm
shifts, and for that matter paradigms themselves, are — and please
do not mistake this for belittlement, quite the opposite in fact —
entirely <em>imaginary</em>. You cannot measure or touch a paradigm. A paradigm
does not emit heat or have mass. Yet paradigms have been the organizing
principle of society since humanity learned how to speak and write
things down. A paradigm is a shared hallucination.</p>
<p>Every paradigm contains the seeds of its own destruction. The bible was
the first book that was mass-printed — shortly after that the
catholic church lost half of its believers to the various protestant
denominations. The feudal and heriditary paradigms of Europe were eroded
and overthrown by the steady growth of capitalism. The industrial
capitalist paradigm had given birth to both fascism and communism
after the Great Depression. And the surviving contenders of the
Second World War created the Cold War (i.e. bipolar) paradigm. This
paradigm collapsed into one of globalisation and informationalism. Trading
new gods for old.</p>
<p>Trust, just like a paradigm, is powered by <em>belief</em>. You cross the
street with minimal anxiety because you trust the drivers to be sober
enough to obey the traffic laws (also another good example of a paradigm). You
use the same two passwords on every site because you trust that the
programmers that made the site have a minimal level of technical
competence and a minimal regard for your security and privacy. Some
Runescape-playing twelve-year-old kid drops all their hard-earned loot
in front of another player and presses <code v-pre>Alt-F4</code> because the other
player told them it was a glitch that would duplicate all of the items
in their inventory — that kid <em>trusted</em> someone who was
<em>untrustworthy</em>, and learned a <em>painful</em> but <em>important</em> lesson about
<em>trust</em>. The internet is basically like that Runescape example. The
entire system depends on trust to get anything done, but there are too
many people and you cannot trust them blindly. What to do? Well, we did
what we have always done, we created institutions (i.e. social networks
and banks) and placed our <em>trust</em> and our <em>faith</em> in <em>them</em>. It sounds
perfectly reasonable, doesn&#x27;t it? Sure. But such institutions are powered by
people, and the people — just like criminals and liars —
have to respond to market-pressures. We used to <em>trust</em> our
credit-rating-agencies to tell us which financial entities were
<em>creditworthy</em> — and then we had an economic <em>meltdown</em> in 2008
that destroyed the <em>trustworthiness</em> of those institutions themselves.
Centralizing trust in a handful of institutions will work in a pinch but
it could eventually, and without warning, fail — may we repeat every paradigm
contains the seeds of its own destruction.</p>

<p>The internet, and especially the Web, are either the result or cause
— hard to tell really — of a paradigm shift. The mass
on-lining of humanity has shifted the power (i.e. the value or economic
surplus) from the previous power-holders (i.e. the mass media, the
industry, the publishers, etc). Think about it, more people watched the
Fortnite tournament than actual sporting events. In fact, viewership of
the <em>Olympics</em> has started declining towards the end of the last decade
— after a half century of <em>growing</em> viewership. Book stores are no
longer mainstream, and the internet&#x27;s pre-eminent book store has evolved
into a titanic giant that sells <em>everything</em> and delivers it to your
residence within 2 days — and they also collect rent for roughly
<em>one third</em> of all computation and storage that is provisioned on a
Cloud. A ride-sharing company has displaced local taxi-cab companies <em>in
the entire world</em> — not merely in a city or a state or a nation.
Video rental stores are few and far between, but the internet&#x27;s
pre-eminent video rental store, Netflix, has emerged as a formidable cultural
force spending tens of billions of dollars per year producing original
and highly regarded, or at least highly viewed, films and television
series.</p>
<p>This is how paradigm shifts work. The above companies tried to build
modest businesses in the not-too-contested corner of the marketplace. The
paradigm starts shifting in their favor and they find themselves
capturing more surplus than they know what to do with. They slowly wake
up to the realization that they are at the top of the pyramid —
not by any strategic brilliance of their own, but rather, because the
pyramid shifted and contorted itself and they happened to be at the
right coordinates at the right time. Western Europe provides an
interesting case study — the place was a backwater far away from
any action until some adventerous sailors and navigators found sea
routes to Asia (that let them by-pass the Eastern Mediteranean
middle-men) and to the Americas (which would eventually house the worlds
most successful and likely last ever hegemon — as always, every
paradigm contains the seeds of its own destruction).</p>

        <span>New Paradigm</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Different people have different ideas about what the next paradigm of
the web is. Web2.0 got us half-way to where we want to be. Its pioneers,
however, could not resist the incentives to maximize the proportion of
the economic surplus that they capture — even though these Web2.0
business are essentially <em>built by the users</em>. And what about Web3.0? Depends on
who you ask. Right now the mainstream thinks that Web3.0 is the
<em>semantic web</em> — a decades-old idea that has always struggled to
gain traction. Meanwhile, an increasing number of people believe that
Web3.0 will center around <em>blockchain technologies</em> — but they
call it <strong>web3</strong> (we will call it Web3.0 from now on in this paper).</p>
<p>We believe that the new paradigm for the internet/web is
hyper-decentralization. The web is decentralizing the media and the news
and the publishing industry. The web is decentralizing geography —
two people a million miles away can interact with each other over
video-chat or VR. The web is decentralizing finance — even stuffy
old banks want to get in on the DeFi bandwagon. The web is
decentralizing the nation-state — people often times have more in
common with globally dispersed like-minded individuals than their fellow
neighbors and citizens. The web is decentralizing employment — the
number of people working in the gig-economy and the creator-economy is
increasing (unfortunately this is another example of users creating a
surplus that is captured by online equivalent of a few feudal lords).</p>
<p>We believe that this accelerating trend of hyper-decentralization will
also decentralize the parts of the web that have to do with <em>trust</em>.
Right now, the intermediary institutions (i.e. Facebook, Twitter,
Reddit, HN, and so on) that ascribe credibility and trustworthiness do
so in ways that are <em>opaque</em>. We do not know <em>why</em> certain tweets appear
in our feeds and others do not — and even if we did, there is
nothing we can do to <em>customize</em> our feed (aside from following/unfollowing
various accounts). We can see a Reddit user&#x27;s karma-score as well as the
score of their individual posts — which is slightly less opaque
than Hacker News&#x27;s ranking system — but we cannot see <em>who</em>
up-voted or down-voted that user&#x27;s posts. In fact, we have no way of
knowing if that karma score has not been accidentally inflated by a
random bit-flip on Reddit&#x27;s servers — let alone if it has been
manipulated by an insider or inflated by a voting ring. Similar logic
applies to Twitter and Hacker News. Hacker News has surprisingly
insightful discussions, in spite of its concealment of vote-metadata for
posts, but it is still suseptible to insider manipulation and voting
rings. Finally, there is the question of whether a single raw integer
— whether it represents total karma or total followers or total
likes or total retweets — can <em>actually</em> capture the
trustworthiness, truthfulness, and popularity of an account and the
content associated with it. Can you determine if someone is going to be
a good and helpful friend or collaborator by the size of their wallet?</p>

        <span>Intro: Three Strains of Economic Thought</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Before we continue with our proposed solution, we should probably take a
brief detour into economics-land and express how our proposal fits into
the main frameworks of economics. From the late 1700s up to the
present-day three economic schools of thought have shaped societies
around the world — namely, the Neoclassical, the Keynesian, and
the Marxian. The Neoclassical school focused on individual freedom and
individual incentives, and rejected any form of state-intervention in
the economy — in other words they assumed that Utopia was
achievable without Leviathan. After the Great Depression set the
Neoclassical Utopia aflame, the Keynesian school arose and argued that a
Utopia could not be maintained without a Leviathan — they argued
that the individual was certainly important, but not nearly as important
as the <em>structure</em> of the economy. These two views correspond to
microeconomics (i.e. reasoning that individuals ruthlessly purseuing
their own self-interest will create the most desirable outcomes for all
of humanity) and macroeconomics (i.e. reasoning that <em>tracking</em>
macroeconomic indicators like GDP, unemployment, inflation, and
interest-rates and <em>tuning</em> those macroeconomic variables will create
the most desirable outcomes for all of humanity). Put differently, one
school thinks that individual behavior and actions <em>cause</em> the economy,,
while the other school thinks that the economy <em>causes</em> individual
actions and behavior. To be clear, we are not taking sides, both points
of view are correct they just disagree about the <em>relative</em> value of one
component in relation to the others. And now onto the Marxian school
which requires its own paragraph.</p>
<p>The Marxians are primarily concerned with <em>the means of production</em>
— specifically, what they are,, who is the class that owns them,,
who is the class that operates them,, what are their outputs,, what is
their economic surplus,, and who captures what proportion of that
surplus. They marvel at the economic efficiency and dynamism unlocked by
the transition from feudalism to capitalism, but they believe that any
arrangement in which the class that operates the means of production but
does not own or control those means is fundementally unjust, and does
not fulfil the (false) promises of Humanism (the philosophy undergirding
both Neoclassical and Keynesian social orders). They also believe that
individuals and economic-structures are always shaping each-other via a
never-ending <em>dialectics</em> — in effect, they are <em>simultaneously</em>
cause <em>and</em> effect. And that is pretty much all of the Marxian school
<em>that is relevant to this paper</em> — there is a lot of other stuff
(i.e. central planning as a suitable alternative to the market) that is
simply not compatible with a globalized marketplace, nor is it
compatible with a trend towards hyper-decentralization.</p>
<p>We basically agree with all of these theories, and want to use the three
perspectives to construct a globally decentralized network that will
give users freedom, control, privacy, and security.</p>

<p>Trying to eliminate the intermediary institutions that ascribe trust is
a little bit like trying to eliminate the police or trying to eliminate
schools. Obviously policing and schooling are very important and nobody
would ever consider decentralizing them, let alone eliminating them. So
should ask ourselves, what kind of a people have no need for the police?
What kind of people have no need for schools? The answer, fellow
traveler, is people that are <em>self-policing</em> and <em>self-schooling</em>.
Obviously, such people are very rare, otherwise we would not need
schools and police departments. However, a computer that is not under
the control of any single individual can in fact be used to implement
this kind of flawless self-regulation. If we go back to that earlier
Runescape example from Section 4, the game could have been programmed to
disallow such acts of deception — whether this makes the game
better is another matter entirely.</p>
<p>What we wish to do is to use the decentralized, history preserving, and
transactional nature of the blockchain to implement an anonymous
trust-network. To be clear, we are <strong>not</strong> trying to replace existing
platforms like Reddit or Twitter — this is <strong>not</strong> <em>XYZ But for
The Blockchain</em>. We do think that blockchain technology will see
adoption in content-creation and content-distribution, but we think that
those domains are related but separate from the domain of <em>trust and
reputation</em>.</p>
<p>Our network associates users with accounts on the blockchain, similar to
how a licence plate is associated with a vehicle — though <em>unlike</em>
a license plate we do not associate the <em>identity</em> of the user with the
account. Each account has a certain number of  <code v-pre>Inter Tokens</code>
associated with it. These coins are <strong>not</strong> a measure of karma or
trustworthiness — rather, they are merely a way to amplify (i.e.
upvote) or dampen (i.e. downvote) other accounts. The network does not
<em>score</em> anything — it merely records the upvotes and downvotes,
which account they came from,, and how many Vote Tokens (more on this
later) have been spent on each upvote or downvote. The idea is that,
voting is not free. When a upvotes they are depositing a percentage of
those votes into the target account — when downvoting, no votes
get deducted from the target account but the downvote-transaction does
get recorded on the blockchain (we do not want users with an
overwhelming amount of vote-tokens to be able to bankrupt accounts that
they dislike). Users can also <em>vouch</em> for other accounts. Vouching is a
special kind of upvote — it allows a user to risk a certain amount
of their vote-tokens to give another user visibility. If the other user
gets upvotes then the upvotes are recorded on the blockchain, but the
vote-tokens are shared between the voucher(s) and the vouchee in
proportion to how much vote-tokens all of these users have vouched. If
the other user gets downvotes then the voucher loses a proportional
amount of vote-tokens — so one should not vouch blindly. Vouching
can be time-limited, and the vouchee has to explicitly accept the vouch.
Lastly users can <em>share</em>. Sharing essentially lets a user post an
arbitrary byte-string to the blockchain — the network charges a
<strong>significant</strong> per-byte fee for sharing. The reasoning is that we want
to incentivize users to post <em>links and URLs</em> to content on other more
mainstream platforms, instead of <em>actual</em> content which we consider
outside of our scope. This essentially allows accounts to act as
<em>curation feeds</em>.</p>
<p>As for the actual <em>scoring</em>, we decentralize this by pushing it to the
<em>edges</em> of the network. The idea is that users can run a scoring program
that will walk the blockchain and build a graph of accounts as connected
by upvotes, downvotes, and vouches — in effect applying a kind of
page-rank algorithm to account. The reason we outsource this to the
client is that it allows people to build things like feeds in a totally
custom way. For example users can play around with <em>biased</em> page-ranks
(i.e. what would happen if we removed Account XYZ from the blockchain
history, or what would happen if we treat these 5 accounts as a single
shared account). The possibilities are endless. What would a feed look
like if Account X was <em>my</em> account? Which accounts have voted for my
account(s)? Which accounts have a similar voting pattern to mine?</p>
<p>Each account is associated with a public cryptographic key. Users can
sign things that they post on the web (i.e. to reddit or to their own
blog), so that users of the Interlock Network can know that the content
was posted by somebody that they trust.</p>
<p>If the Interlock Network sees wider adoption, website admins can include
a custom HTTP header that includes a signed Interlock Network account
number — if a user has installed a Interlock-Network-aware
browser-extension they can automatically inspect that account&#x27;s history
and various rankings, interactions, and scores. Years ago, Paul Graham
said that he asked applicants to Y Combinator provide their Hacker News
account-name as an additional data-point for YC to consider when
evaluating the applicants and their proposals — we believe that
the Interlock Network can be used in a similar capacity, <em>but across the
entire internet</em>. Everything from online stores to online gaming
communities can make use of the data stored in the Interlock Network to
ascertain the trustworthiness of the participants. Even in the domain of
startups, companies with a good reputation on the Interlock Network can
offer their employees Inter Tokens or upvotes in lieu of stock or
shares.</p>
<p>If Web2.0 was about <em>websites</em> and <em>services</em>, we believe that Web3.0 is
about <em>people</em> and <em>content</em> and their <em>trustworthiness</em>.</p>

<p>An interesting application of the Interlock Network would be as a way to
implement a <em>favor exchange</em>. Think of it this way — you want
someone to do you a favor (i.e. you want them to farm potato-cactuses on
Runescape) so you give them an NFT Inter Token and they do you a solid
favor. Now that the favor is complete, the favor-doer has an NFT token
that is directly linked to you that indicates that <em>you</em> owe <em>them</em> a
favor. Once you do them a favor, they will give you a corresponding NFT
token that will cancel out your original token. The cool thing about
this, is that it encourages the development of long-lived bilateral
relationships between accounts and people — whereas the exchange
of money generally encourages us to treat other human beings as
vending-machines that do things for us because we we inserted money into
them. Clearly it is possible for the two users to never reach an
agreement on whether a favor was ever actually completed, in which case
the NFT can be reclaimed by the issuer — whether or not this is
true is not nearly as important as it being permanently recorded on the
blockchain, and the page-rank algorithm can do its magic.</p>

<p>Security is a difficult problem — it has <em>always</em> been a difficult
problem. Throwing blockchain at the problem won&#x27;t automatically fix it.
If websites were signed using a Interlock Network account-signature many
phishing attacks — the most common and most successful kind of
attack — would be a lot less feasible. However, Interlock Network
does not yet exist — and even if it did it would only protect the
users that have an account on it from websites that belong to <em>other</em>
users that have an account on it. So while the Interlock Network concept
has enormous potential and could be an extremely powerful security
mechanism — if widely used and adopted — it is not a good
starting point.</p>
<p>Our company, Interlock, has developed an extension — a fork of
uBlock — that, in addition to the usual ad-blocking functions, can
also detect whether a website is fraudulent based on very effective,
widely tested, heuristics. When a user opens a webpage that the
extension thinks is fraudulent or untrustworthy, the extension will
prevent any user input to the page and issue a warning in the form of a
large red banner. The extension has already seen use in some large
companies that you have definitely heard of — and for most of its
life it has been out of the reach of non-corporate users. Our plan is to
make this extension available to <em>everyone</em> but to modify it to work
with Interlock Network. When the user installs the extension they can
open an account on the Interlock Network, link it to the extension, and
we will deposite some amount of Inter Tokens into their account. As they
use the extension they will get a variable-time and variable-quantity
reward for using it. They can also get additional Inter Tokens if they
verify that a link dangerous — though this is opt-in as it would
require us to request that verification from a random subset of users
that are not too tightly connected on the Interlock Network. The
extension will also be extended to allow sharing of links from the
browser on the Interlock Network. Users can also flag webpages as either
being malicious or <em>containing</em> malicious content (i.e. a comment on
reddit or a video on youtube). And finally the extension can also be
used to explore the data stored in the Interlock Network.</p>
<p>Naturally, we encourage the community to create alternative extensions.
For example an extension that mimics the old StumbleUpon extension would
be very cool to see. Also an extension that mimics the functionality of
Google Reader, but for Interlock Network shares rather than actual RSS
feeds.</p>

<p>The <strong>Know Your Customer</strong> laws are an interesting example of laws that
require establishing the trustworthiness of a customer. In principle it
is basically the same concept as checking whether a website is legitimate or
fraudulent or whether an account on the Interlock Network is highly
regarded or shunned. Obviously, if all transactions happened on the
Interlock Network — or on <em>any</em> blockchain — KYC laws would
be trivial to implement. That is one of the nice side effects of
complete transparency. We can combine the data on the Interlock Network
with data — <em>anonymized</em> of course — that we gather from the
extension to help the relevant Web3.0 financial institutions (i.e.
namely crypto-exchanges and banks that want to jump onto the DeFi train)
stay in compliance with the KYC regulations.</p>

<p>To back our smart-contracts and our token we have chosen the <strong>Solana</strong>
blockchain technology as our transaction-processing platform-component
and <strong>Ethereum</strong> as the platform-component on which we mint the actual
tokens. Solana has addressed many of the outstanding problems found in
similar popular blockchains like Ethereum (i.e. transaction-speed,
energy-efficiency, infinite-smart-contract-loops, etc). In fact, the
Interlock Network is simply not feasible on any blockchain that does not
have cheap transactions. We had hoped that we would be able to use
Ethereum since it has an enormous ecosystem and is very popular, but its
transactions are thousands of times more expensive than Solana&#x27;s. We do
however recognize the value of Ethereum&#x27;s ERC-20 standard and the
ability to use existing wallets and to transact with other people on
Ethereum — so we are minting the coins on Ethereum but connecting
them to Solana using the Wormhole bridge between these two blockchains.
Ideally, we would use a single popular blockchain like Ethereum but the
physics and economics of these technologies makes that impossible, presently.
However, if the newer versions of Ethereum increase the TPS
and decrease their transaction-costs we could see ourselves porting our
code over to these future versions of Ethereum — assuming that
Solana does not supplant Ethereum in the meantime.</p>
<p>To be honest, we are still not 100 percent certain that our
Solana-Ethereum hybrid is going to be able to implement all of the
features that we desire for the Interlock Network to have. Worst case,
we will have to implement our own blockchain from scratch — we are
still evaluating options. At minimum we will use Solana-Ethereum as a
test-bed for the basic idea and move on from there.</p>

<p>Just wanted to circle back to the three economic paradigms mentioned
earlier. The Interlock Network satifies both the
neoclassical-individualist and keynesian-structuralist perspectives
because we can infer a very precise <em>structure</em> from the recorded
transaction-history between <em>individuals</em> — in fact if the
Interlock Network gains wide adoption it will be of
significant interest to all kinds of economists and sociologists.
Furthermore we have tried to design the incentives to encourage
pro-social use of the blockchain — but of course if any economists
(or non-economists) want to chime in then please go ahead. As for the
marxians, they can take pleasure in the fact that (a) the user&#x27;s
privacy, relationships, and attention (i.e. the means of production for
the information age) are owned by the collective and not by people whose
names rhyme with Stark Truckerberg or Track Horsey and (b) the user has
the final say over which accounts are more attention-worthy than others.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We have given you a short overview and justification of which
blockchains will be used as a test-bed for the Interlock Network, now we
will give some concrete details about how this will be implemented on
top of Solana-Ethereum. So far, we have spoken of the Interlock Network
as if it was a proper stand-alone blockchain, so that we can get the
<em>idea</em> of a P2P reputation network across to you. However, there are
some significant implementation details that diverge from our <em>idealized
description</em> of the Interlock Network that we used in the previous sections.</p>
<p>Pretty much all software that runs on a blockchain is going to be much
slower — and more expensive — than traditional software that
runs on raw silicon (or even in a VM). We should start with the good
news — transactions in Solana are extremely cheap, costing only
about 10-USD to execute a <em>million</em> transactions. The <em>bad</em> news is that
per-account storage is severely limited and severely expensive. On
Solana each account can only store a maximum of 10MB of data — which
is not enough for our history-based reputation scoring — and each
MB costs 3.56 SOL to store per year — which comes out to
10MB-years costing 1200-USD at the current SOL-USD exchange ratio (1 SOL
is worth 33 to 34 USD). Storing data directly on the Solana blockchain
is not feasible. Other blockchains do allow storing of <em>more</em> data than
Solana but storing this data still has pretty steep costs (i.e. writing
1MB of data to Ethereum costs a staggering 76-USD one-time-fee).</p>
<p>As a result of these economic realities, we will use Solana as a P2P
transaction processor — but not as a storage engine. Instead, we
will use Solana&#x27;s WebSocket API to listen for transaction-notifications
that involve our Interlock Network smart-contracts. These notifications
— which are basically transaction logs — will be stored in
the Postgres-based timeseries database called TimescaleDB. We will make
this DB publically readable — but rate-limited, for economic
reasons. Full archives of the DB will be made available weekly via
BitTorrent (or something with similar or better properties — we
are keeping an eye on Storj and related technologies) so that users of
Interlock Network can query this data locally, with minimal latency, and
with minimal API fees. It is our goal to make this data — these
transaction logs — the property of the <em>entire internet</em> and not
just a single company. We should also note that <em>anybody</em> can snoop on
the JSON RPC API that Solana exposes and build their own data-base
— so there is no danger of Interlock drawing up the bridge and
charging exorbitant fees on a whim. The reason that we offer an API and
a BitTorrent archive is that the Solana API has a limited retention
period. Our understanding is that retention can be configured on a
per-validator basis — so some validators might have more or less
transanction-history than others. The only way for Interlock to have the
full history is to run our own validator — which certainly sounds
like fun — but that would be overkill because we only care about a
tiny subset of the millions of transactions that happen on the Solana
blockchain. By providing a public API and distributing an archive we are
making it possible for people to see, and verify, the complete
Interlock Network history.</p>
<p>As for the smart-contracts themselves, our plan is to implement a single
smart-contract <em>per verb</em>. As discussed previously, there are only a
handful of verbs — i upvote, i downvote, i vouch, i share, and i
quid-pro-quo. Each verb is basically its own smart-contract and takes an
account number as an argument. The account invoking the verb pays for
the cost of the transaction — which is measured in thousandths of
a SOL — as well as a tiny and negligible percentage to an
interlock-owned account — this is to help fund the development of
the Interlock Network and other related Interlock products. The verbs
upvote, downvote, and vouch are pretty straight forward to implement
since they just manipulate balances and store no data. Implementing a
<em>share</em> however, is a bit more of a challenge because of the high
storage-fees on Solana. When the share-program is invoked, it is done
via a transaction, which contains opaque 8-bit instruction-data. This
instruction data is <em>thrown away</em> by the share-program as soon as it
gets it — however, WebSocket listeners will <em>snatch</em> all the
metadata about the transaction including the 8-bit instruction-data, <em>so
it is not lost</em>. If the data is longer than <em>560 bytes</em> our <em>share
program</em> will emit an error and our listeners will <em>ignore</em> the
transaction — 560 bytes is enough to encode meaningful meta-data
about content (i.e. a link along with perhaps a checksum of some kind).
The <em>share</em> smart-contract will charge a one-time per-byte fee to
incentivize users to keep their shared content as short as possible
— and to disincentivize the spamming of our database.</p>
<p>The <em>quid-pro-quo program</em> is very similar to the <em>upvote</em> program,
except it mints and deposits an account-specific NFT that cannot be
withdrawn or spent by the receiving account — see the previous
section, <em>quid pro quo</em>, for more details.</p>

    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Since we are already talking about Solana and architecture, it seems
natural to segue into the tokenomics of our Inter Token currency. Most
tokens and cryptocurrencies like to make guarantees about the maximum
supply of their tokens. We feel that having to choose between inflation
and deflation is a false dichotamy. We clearly want to make use of the
century of brainpower that went into monetary theory and the
more-than-half-century of brain-power that went into game-theory
(specifically the subfield of mechanism design) to create both long-term
and short-term incentives that will encourage pro-social behaviour and
participation on the Interlock Network.</p>
<p>We want people to vote, but we also want them to vote thoughtfully
— to that end votes are emphatically <strong>not</strong> free. They cost
Inter Token. We also do not want people to hoard Inter Tokens, because
that means that they are not voting. This is why we actually have
different <em>flavors</em> of Inter Token. The vanilla Inter Token is like any
other token that can be bought and traded. But we also air-drop a
vote-only flavor of Inter Token these coins are only good for voting
— except for the occaisional token-swap in which an account can
exchange their vote-only tokens for the actual Inter Token. A vote-token
is either spent or unspent — if unspent it is not exchangable. In
other words, when a user votes they transfer their unspent token to the
account that they voted for, but their <em>own</em> account receives a <em>spent</em>
token that cannot be used for anything — except buying
Inter Token. This is very much like Japan&#x27;s policy of <em>Window Guidance</em>
— except we are guiding voting behaviour, instead of corporate
behaviour.</p>
<p>Voting activity is obviously done via its own tokens, but what about
sharing? We feel that sharing should be billed directly in Inter Token.
Unlike voting, where we do not wish people to hoard their votes, sharing
is a little different. We certainly want people to share, but we do not
want them to <em>spam</em> our DB with <em>noise</em>. For example, at 560 bytes and
200 billion — the number of yearly tweets processed by twitter at
time of writing — shares per year, the Interlock Network accounts
would be generating 101 TB of data per year. That is a <em>lot</em> of data to
store, index, mirror, and distribute — we want to make every byte
count, specifically so ordinary users can feasibly do their own
mirroring and querying. This state of affairs does give users with more
Inter Tokens (i.e. because of more received upvotes or because they
purchased more) a bit of a social edge. We are not entirely sure if that
is a good thing or bad thing. We have considered various policies, such
as distributing the share-costs across the entire network as a
<em>percentage</em>, or at least doubling the per-byte fee <em>with each new
share</em> — on a per account-basis — so that accounts can share
cheaply at least once a day, but they cannot firehose every random
brainwave onto the network. The former policy might incentivize
account-owners to engage in complex behaviors akin to tax-evasion and
capital-flight. The latter policy seems more sensible and equitable, but
this is one of those things that will probably require extensive
experimentation before we can accept it as a <em>good idea</em>. We suspect
that the economics of sharing will motivate people to post a handful of
links to things like their blogs, personal-websites, twitter-accounts,
github-accounts, and aggregators using those specialized platforms for
sharing, in order to avoid paying for something that the Web can provide
for free. This possible outcome suits us just fine, as it creates a high
signal-to-noise ratio — which is exactly what we are after.</p>

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>To facilitate investment in the project we are going to pursue a DAICO
model. The idea behind the model is that investors can invest a specific
amount of SOL or ETH (they can choose to invest on either Ethereum or
Solana) into an investment-fund account for the Interlock Network project. This
account has a monthly limit on withdrawals and any withdrawals beyond
that limit would have to be voted on by the investors. A fixed number of
SOL/ETH can be invested (i.e. the target number) and investors cannot
exceed a maximum-proportion (which is <strong>five percent</strong> of the target
number). Investors have voting-power which is proportional to the amount
that they have invested. Each new round of investment will be a new
DAICO involving a different investment-account and the same — or
slightly tweaked — smart-contract to manage those funds. The
presence of multiple and unlimited rounds is to give new investors an
opportunity to participate fairly and equitably in the project. The
presence of proportion-limits is to ensure (a) a minimum number of
investors (i.e. 20) and (b) that no single investor has unilateral veto
power during a vote. Investors will also receive ownership over accounts
with a proportional amount of voting Inter Tokens as well a normal
Inter Tokens. Each investor will also receive upvotes from
the Interlock Team upvoting them as a form of symbolic thanks.</p>
<p>For this to work correctly, we will have to break away from our theme of
privacy and anonymity — allowing anonymous investors would be the
same as allowing any investor to invest a proportion larger than 5
percent, which defeats the purpose. Additionally, allowing anonymous
investors might interfere with KYC laws. Though, we can probably
experiment with fully anonymous rounds for smaller investment targets
(i.e. a few dozen thousand dollars).</p>
<p>We are also interested in trying to raise funds on Solstarter when that
platform is ready — but until they launch we will have to go with
the DAICO model. <strong>We will update this section with details for how the
inaugural DAICO round will be ran soon</strong>.</p>

        <span>Technical Contributions</span>
    </h2>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We will follow an RFD/RFC model for techincal contributions; where
project design documents are proposed and discussed on various community
channels (i.e. github, discord, and others). If the project and
community get large enough we will likely adopt a governance model akin
to Rust&#x27;s. We will diverge from the traditional RFC process in that we (a)
adopt proposals by voting via smart-contract and (b) developers can show
their support and affinity for each-other and their ideas by using the
upvote/downvote mechanism that is already in place. We do not require
separete personal and developer accounts, but we also do not require the
same account. Keeping with the theme of privacy and anonymity a
developer can have as many accounts as they want and the
project/community would have no way of knowing — which is
<em>already</em> the situation in the real world (i.e. one can make as many
github accounts as they want). Voting is consensus-driven —
proposals require unanimous approval. Unanimous consensus is meant to
eliminate the competitive nature of voting — all disagreements
should be resolved at the <em>discussion</em> phase before a proposal comes to
a vote. We believe that there are very few <em>true</em> and <em>unresolvable</em>
contradictions in engineering. Proposals can be resubmitted for voting.</p>
<p>Each technical contributor is given an NFT that allows them to vote.
Each technical contributor must explicitly refresh their NFT every 30
days otherwise it gets burned. The idea is that if a contributor drops
off the grid, their absence will not cause the system to lock-up. The
Interlock Team can always issue new NFT&#x27;s to contributors returning from
a hiatus. The Interlock Team can also burn the NFT&#x27;s of anybody who has
not contributed any code in the previous 300 days — we have not
found a way to enforce this via smart-contract so the process is, at the
moment, manual.</p>
